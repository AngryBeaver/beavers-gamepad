## Description
This module is intended to be used in local sessions with one Map Monitor and multiple connected gamepads.
Each gamepad can be assigned to an actor.

You can add GamepadModules to a gamepad and configure them. 
Initially at least one GamepadModule is available "Beaver's Token movement" which allows to move the actors token around.

## Addon
You can write Addons a.k.a GamepadModules. There will be soon a section on how to do this.
